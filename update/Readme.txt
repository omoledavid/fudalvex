-> Create a backup of your old files
-> Remove (delete) the old files from where it is installed (sub-domain, sub-folder, public_html, etc..)
-> upload the new script files you downloaded from codecanyon and extract it in the location you want. (usually where the previous files was).
-> Enter the database credentials in the .env file (look up the values in the old .env file from the backup folder.)

-> test your website in the browser and see if it is working.
